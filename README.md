# Linked List Practice

Recently I have taken it upon myself to learn more about javascript, algorithms and data structures to broaden my knowledge. I used multiple resources such as youtube videos and websites such as Codecademy learn more about this data structure. What I have learned is that a linked list is a collection of nodes that contain some data and a reference to the next node in the list. The list created in the files is a singular linked list meaning the nodes only have reference to the next node and not the previous, as would be the case in a double linked list. An example real world use case for a linked list could be navigation as when navigating you often get a list of directions each one following on from the previous. A double linked list could be your browser history. When you go to a new page you are creating the next node in your history and when you press the back button you are going to the previous node.

As you will see I have created Jest tests following a test driven development process as this helps think about what is needing to be done for each function and of course, when implemented correctly they turn green!
